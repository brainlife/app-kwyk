# app-NOBRAINER
This app executes https://github.com/neuronets/nobrainer/ - bayesian brain parcellation

Nobrainer is a deep learning framework for 3D image processing. It implements several 3D convolutional models from recent literature, methods for loading and augmenting volumetric data that can be used with any TensorFlow or Keras model, losses and metrics for 3D data, and simple utilities for model training, evaluation, prediction, and transfer learning.

Nobrainer also provides pre-trained models for brain extraction, brain segmentation, and other tasks. Please see the Nobrainer models repository for more information.

## Running the App 

### On Brainlife.io

You can submit this App online at [https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.218](https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.218) via the "Execute" tab.

### Running Locally (on your machine)

1. git clone this repo.
2. Inside the cloned directory, create `config.json` with something like the following content with paths to your input files.

```json
{
  "t1": "t1.nii.gz"
}
```

3. Launch the App by executing `main`

```bash
./main
```

### Sample Datasets

If you don't have your own input file, you can download sample datasets from Brainlife.io, or you can use [Brainlife CLI](https://github.com/brain-life/cli).

```
npm install -g brainlife
bl login
mkdir input
bl dataset download 5a0f0fad2c214c9ba8624376#5a050966eec2b300611abff2 && mv 5a0f0fad2c214c9ba8624376#5a050966eec2b300611abff2 .
```

## Output

All output file (a resampled T1w NIFTI-1 file) will be generated inside the current working directory (pwd), inside a specifc directory called:

```
out_dir
```
